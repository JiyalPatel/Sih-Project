Inputs (Raw Data to Provide)

1. **Faculty Details**

   * Faculty ID, Name
   * Department
   * Subjects they can teach
   * Max hours/week (load capacity)
   * Preferred slots (optional)
   * Unavailable slots (leave, admin duty, etc.)

2. **Subjects / Courses**

   * Subject code & name
   * Department / semester
   * Type: Lecture / Lab / Tutorial
   * Hours per week (e.g., 3 lectures + 1 lab)
   * Number of sections needing this subject
   * Faculty eligible to teach (link to faculty list)

3. **Classrooms / Labs**

   * Room ID & type (lecture hall, lab, seminar)
   * Capacity (students it can hold)
   * Special facilities (projector, computers, lab equipment)
   * Availability (e.g., some labs only open certain hours)

4. **Students / Sections**

   * Section ID (e.g., CSE-3A)
   * Department & semester
   * Subjects required for that semester
   * Strength (student count)

5. **Timetable Structure**

   * Working days (Mon–Fri, Mon–Sat)
   * Periods per day (e.g., 6 or 8)
   * Period duration (e.g., 1 hr)
   * Breaks (lunch, short breaks)

##  Constraints (Rules to Follow)

### Hard Constraints (must not be violated ❌)

* A faculty cannot be in **two places at the same time**.
* A room/lab cannot be assigned to **two classes at the same time**.
* A section cannot attend **two subjects at the same time**.
* Room capacity ≥ student strength.
* Lab subjects must be in labs, lecture subjects in classrooms.
* Subject hours/week must be satisfied.
* Max hours/week per faculty cannot be exceeded.

### Soft Constraints (preferences, can be relaxed ✅)

* Faculty preferred time slots (e.g., no early mornings).
* Balanced distribution of classes (avoid all on the same day).
* Avoid long gaps in a section’s schedule.
* Avoid overloading faculty (too many back-to-back classes).
* Allocate core subjects in morning slots, electives later.
* Try to minimize free periods for students/faculty.

So basically:

* **Inputs = all the data** (faculty, subjects, sections, rooms, structure).
* **Constraints = rules to respect while scheduling.**
